#🚀 Task 02 Completed – Stopwatch Web Application ⏱️

I developed an interactive and user-friendly Stopwatch Web App that allows users to accurately measure and record time intervals.

✨ Key Features:
✅ Start, Pause, and Reset functionality
✅ Lap time tracking for recording multiple intervals
✅ Real-time time display for precision
✅ Clean and responsive UI for a smooth user experience

This project helped me strengthen my JavaScript, HTML, and CSS skills while focusing on creating practical, real-world applications.

💡 Excited to keep building more projects and enhancing my development journey!
